  * The stores where the information will be updated.
  * The root category where the incoming category branch will be set.

## How To Start

### 1. Module package install process

#### 1.1 Download the package in your Magento

> **Warning**.
> Install the plugin only automatically or manually. If you try to install it with both methods at the same time, in step 1.2 Magento will return an error.

##### 1.1.1 Via Composer. In your Magento root folder, execute command:
```
composer require saleslayer/magento-enterprise-plugin
```
See [manage extensions on Adobe Commerce][magento-manage-extensions] for more info.

> **Info**
> If you have a previous version of the plugin installed in root folder 'app/code', please delete the complete folder of the plugin before moving forward with the plugin's installation via Composer.

Once executed and installed, the plugin will be found in your Magento installation root path, inside the folder 'vendor/saleslayer/magento-enterprise-plugin/

##### 1.1.1.1 Composer command examples
To install the latest latest valid version of the main branch: 
```
composer require saleslayer/magento-enterprise-plugin
```

To install the latest valid version having the 2.7.* tag (the number of version can be changed to any tag number that includes Composer): 
```
composer require saleslayer/magento-enterprise-plugin "2.7.*" 
```

Branch feature-295 will be installed (the branch name can be changed to any branch that includes Composer):
```
composer require saleslayer/magento-enterprise-plugin:dev-feature_295
```

##### 1.1.1.2 Composer requirements
Following Version guidance, check the plugin version to check which PHP and Magento version are required to install the plugin.

In case a requirement is not met, an error will be given by Composer.

> **Info**
> This will only happen if your Magento installation doesnâ€™t met the requirements of the specific branch or tag version being installed, or by default, none of the main branch releases.
##### 1.1.2 Manually. Download the latest version zip and uncompress it into your Magento root folder 'app/code'

> **Warning**.
> Since plugin 2.7.0 version, this method will be deprecated. We strongly recommend to install the plugin via Composer. See step 1.1.1.

#### 1.2 From Magento root folder execute commands:

```php

php bin/magento setup:upgrade
php bin/magento setup:di:compile (if there's an error with 'var/di/' folder just delete it and execute this command again)
php bin/magento setup:static-content:deploy
php bin/magento cache:clean

```

#### 1.3 After executing the commands, Sales Layer module will be installed

### 2. Create a Sales Layer Magento connector and map the fields

#### 2.1 The plugin needs the connector ID code and the private key, you will find them in the connector details of Sales Layer.

### 3. Add the connector credencials in Magento

#### 3.1 Go to Sales Layer -> Import -> Add connector and add the connector id and secret key.
#### 3.2 Finally, In Sales Layer -> Import -> The connector you created, push Synchronize Connector to import categories, products and variants automatically.
